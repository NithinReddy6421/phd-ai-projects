# 3D Vision Reconstruction Project

This project demonstrates a basic 3D reconstruction pipeline using COLMAP and point-cloud visualization tools.

## Contents
- src/colmap_reader.py — reads COLMAP outputs
- src/visualize_pointcloud.py — shows point clouds in 3D
- requirements.txt — dependencies

## Purpose
This project is part of my PhD application portfolio, showing experience with 3D vision, point clouds, and structure-from-motion tools.
