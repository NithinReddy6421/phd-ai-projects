# Experiments and reproducibility

- Config file: use consistent camera models, feature params, and matching thresholds.
- Metrics to report: mean reprojection error, completeness (% points recovered), mesh quality (Hausdorff distance).
- Save all command lines used in `experiments/commands.txt` for reproducibility.
